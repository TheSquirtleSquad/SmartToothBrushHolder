# SmartToothBrushHolder
MQTT Smart Tooth Brush Holder for Easy Integration with Home Assistant.

## How It works

2 Limit Switches in are at the bottom of each tooth brush slot, when the tooth brush is removed the switches open.
the ESP reads this transition after 5 seconds and fires an event to MQTT.

## 3D Model
Sample 3D Model holds kids battry operated tooth brushes, not all tooth brushes will trigger the limit switches

## ESP Source Code

Firmeware must be updated with WIFI SSID/PASSWORD and MQTT information before flashing, flashing can be done with Arduino IDE

## TODO
- Add Home Assistant Configuration Settings
- Add Support for Other Tooth Brush Sizes
